# InsightsAnalysis_PTData
Analysis of PT data for insights M360 reports/model
Current Functions:
  a) Run SQL query based on parameters to download PT Data
  b) Use existing map to assign new taxonomy and identify SKUs that are unmapped.

Things to do:
1) Create a separate file for parameters (Excel preferably)
2) Encapsulate in classes and add ability to modify based on therapy area and device series.
3) Simplify running the code.
